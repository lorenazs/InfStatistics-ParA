Exponential distribution Simulation 
========================================================

This is the first part of the project for the Statistical inference course.
The exponential distribution was simulated with the function rexp(n,lambda), using lambda = 0.2

### 0. The simulation
First run thousand times the simulated data for n=40, lambda=0.2 and stored the mean of each sample in a vector
